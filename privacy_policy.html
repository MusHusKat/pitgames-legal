  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">Snake by Pit Games &nbsp;·&nbsp; Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <p>
    Pit Games ("we", "us", or "our") built <strong>Snake</strong> as a free mobile game.
    This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure
    of personal information when you use our app.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The current version of Snake does <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or share
    any personal information. All game data (player name, score, level, selected theme,
    selected skin) is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong> using Android's
    shared preferences storage. This data never leaves your device.
  </p>

  <h2>Device Permissions</h2>
  <p>The app requests the following permission:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Internet</strong> — declared for future features (leaderboards, cloud save).
      The current version does not make any network requests.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The current version of Snake does not integrate any third-party SDKs, analytics
    services, advertising networks, or crash reporting tools. We plan to add these in a
    future update, at which point this policy will be updated accordingly.
  </p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Snake is suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information
    from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Because no data is collected
    or transmitted, there is no risk of inadvertent data collection from children.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this privacy policy as new features are added to the app. Any changes
    will be reflected on this page with an updated date. We encourage you to review this
    page periodically.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
